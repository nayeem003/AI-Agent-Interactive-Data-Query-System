# **AI Agent: Interactive Data Query System**

This project allows users to upload **CSV files** or provide **public Google Sheets URLs** and ask **natural language queries**. Powered by a **Language Learning Model (LLM)**, the application generates context-aware responses based on the uploaded data.

## **‚ú® Key Features**
- **Multi-format Input**: Accepts both CSV files and public Google Sheets links for data input.
- **Dynamic Query Response**: Processes natural language queries and provides tailored responses based on the uploaded data.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
  - Upload files or link Google Sheets effortlessly.
  - Preview uploaded data within the interface.
  - Ask questions dynamically.
  - Download query responses as CSV files.
- **Seamless Integration**:
  - Leverages Google Sheets API for fetching sheet data.
  - Uses Groq's advanced LLM for generating intelligent responses.
